The identified types of documentation and their RECOMMENDED content are README file(one-paragraph description of the application, a "Getting Started" step-by-step description on how to get a development environment running, automated test execution how-to, links to external documentation below, contributing code of conduct, versioning specification, author list and contacts, license information and acknowledgements), Developer documentations (Private API documentation, structure and interfaces and build documentation), Deployment and Administration documentations (Installation and configuration guides, service reference card, FAQs and troubleshooting) and user documentations (Public API documentation and command-line reference). | Aut |Supportability | |
| QC.Sec01 | OWASP Compliance |Compliance with Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) secure coding guidelines is RECOMMENDED, even for non-web applications. | Aut |Security | |
| QC.Sec02 | Static application security testing (SAST) | Source code SHALL use automated linter tools to perform static application security testing (SAST) that flag common suspicious constructs that may cause a bug or lead to a security risk (e.g. inconsistent data structure sizes or unused resources). | Aut |Security | |
| QC.Sec03 | Security code reviews | Security code reviews for certain vulnerabilities SHOULD be done as part of the identification of potential security flaws in the code. Inputs SHOULD come from automated linters and manual penetration testing results. | Aut/Man |Security | |
| QC.Sec04 | Files & Directories presence | World-writable files or directories MUST NOT be present in the product's configuration or logging locations. | Aut |Security | |
| QC.Wor01 | Working state version | The main branch in the source code repository MUST maintain a working state version of the software component. Main branch SHOULD be protected to disallow force pushing, thus preventing untested and un-reviewed source code from entering the production-ready version. New features SHOULD only be merged in the main branch whenever the SQA criteria is fulfilled. | Aut | Maintainability | |
| QC.Wor02 | Change Branches | New changes in the source code MUST be placed in individual branches. It is RECOMMENDED to agree on a branch nomenclature, usually by prefixing, to differentiate change types (e.g. feature, release, fix). | Man | Maintainability | |
| QC.Wor03 | Secondary long-term branch | The existence of a secondary long-term branch that contains the changes for the next release is RECOMMENDED. Next release changes come from the individual branches. Once ready for release, changes in the secondary long-term branch are merged into the main branch and versioned. At that point in time, main and secondary branches are aligned. This step SHOULD mark a production release.  | Man | Maintainability | |
| QC.Ver01 | Semantic Versioning specification | Semantic Versioning specification is RECOMMENDED for tagging the production releases. | Aut  | Maintainability | |
| QC.Man01 | Issue tracker |An issue tracking system facilitates structured software development. Leveraging issues to track down both new enhancements and defects (bugs, documentation typos) is RECOMMENDED. | Aut | Maintainability | |
| QC.Man02 | Pull or merge requests | In social coding environments, pull or merge requests represent the cornerstone of collaboration. A pull or merge request provides a place for review and discussion of the changes proposed to be part of an existing version of the code. | Man | Maintainability | |
| QC.Rev01 | Code review functionality |Code reviews MUST be done in the agreed peer review tool within the project, with the following RECOMMENDED functionality: (a) Allows general and specific comments on the line or lines that need to be reviewed. (b) Shows the results of the required change-based test executions. (c) Allows to prevent merges of the candidate change whenever not all the required tests are successful. \\Exceptions to this rule cover the third-party or upstream contributions which MAY use the existing mechanisms or tools for code review provided by the target software project. This exception MUST only be allowed whenever the external revision lifecycle does not interfere with the project deadlines. | Man |Maintainability | |
| QC.Rev02 | Open and collaborative | Code reviews MUST be open and collaborative, allowing external expert revisions. | Man | Maintainability | |
| QC.Rev03 | Lightweight and Informal | Code reviews SHOULD be lightweight and informal, meaning that some of the areas the reviewers MAY focus are: (a) Message description: commit message is clear, self-explanatory and describes precisely the objectives being addressed. (b) Goal or scope: change is needed and/or addresses/fixes the whole set of objectives. (c) Code analysis: useless statements in the code, library or modules imported but never used or code style suggestions. (d) Review of required tests: current battery of tests is sufficient for validation. (e) Review of documentation: whether the change SHOULD bring along a corresponding update in the documentation. | Man | Maintainability | |
| QC.Rev04 | Code review checks | Code reviews MUST be checked on change basis. | Man | Maintainability | |
| QC.Rev05 | Security risk assessments | Code reviews SHOULD assess the inherent security risk of the changes, ensuring that the security model has not been downgraded or compromised by the changes. | Man | Maintainability | |
| QC.Del01 | Automated Delivery | Production-ready code MUST be built as an artifact that can be efficiently executed on a system. | Aut | Installability | |
| QC.Del02 | Register artifact | The built artifact MUST be uploaded and registered into a public repository of such artifacts. | Aut | Installability | |
| QC.Del03 | Notification upon registration | Upon success of the previous (QC.Del02) process, a noti cation MUST be sent to pre-defined parties such as the main developer or team. | Aut | Installability | |
| QC.Dep01 | Code deployment | Production-ready code MUST be deployed as a workable system with the minimal user or system administrator interaction leveraging software configuration management (SCM) tools.| Aut | Installability | |
| QC.Dep02 | SCM module as code | A software configuration management (SCM) module is treated as code. Version controlled, it SHOULD reside in a different repository than the source code to facilitate the distribution. | Aut | Installability  | |
| QC.Dep03 | SCM tool | It is RECOMMENDED that all software components delivered by the same project agree on a common SCM tool. However, software products are not restricted to provide a unique solution for the automated deployment. | Aut | Installability | |
| QC.Dep04 | SCM Code Changes | Any change affecting the applications deployment or operation MUST be subsequently reflected in the relevant SCM modules. | Aut | Installability | |
| QC.Dep05 | Official repositories | Official repositories provided by the manufacturer SHOULD be used to host the SCM modules, thus augmenting the visibility and promote external collaboration. | Aut | Installability | |
