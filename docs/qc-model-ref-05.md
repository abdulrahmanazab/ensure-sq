|  TDD     | Test Driven Development | Define and code unit tests for each small bit of program functionality  | Man  |  Functional suitability, Maintainability  |  Test-first development (or TDD) forces the programmer to think about many aspects of the program feature before coding it. It helps design and improves maintainability, ensuring that refactoring, updates, or new features do not break existing functionalities. |
|          | Defect rates | The number of outstanding defects in a product | Aut |  Operability (?)  | According to the author, by using the TDD approach, the production defect rate significantly decreases.  |
