| 8.1  | Reliability | The reliability of systems from the user's point of view is concerned with three things: (1) How often does it go wrong? (2) How long is it unavailable? (3) Is any information lost at recovery? | Aut | | System in operation / production |
| 8.2  | Efficiency  | The critical resources needed by the operator to carry out the critical tasks can be monitored e.g. if staff time is the critical resource, the elapsed time taken is the best measure o f efficiency. On the other hand, if the computer disk storage is critical, then the percentage of disk space required to carry out the task is the best measure available.                        | Aut or Man | | May or may not be automated, System in operation / production |
| 8.3  | Security    | This may be measured as the resource cost expended to solve problems caused by unauthorized activity. This resource cost may appear in a number of ways, e.g. staff time to recover system (time) or loss of information (bytes or value). | Man | Security | Not easy to automate |
| 8.4  | Integrity   | This may be measured as the resource cost expended to solve problems caused by inconsistencies within the system. This may be measured in terms of staff time  employed to fix problems and user time wasted. | Man | | |
| 8.5  | Usability   | This may be measured using user surveys as, apparently, IBM do. However, it may also be assessed in terms of calls upon support staff, e.g. number o f requests for help or support staff time expended. | Man | | |
| 8.6  | Maintainability | This may most simply be measured by the resources expended in terms of time and cost in keeping a system up and running over a period of time. | Man | | |
| 8.7  | Adaptability | Measured in the same way as maintainability, i.e. by the resources expended in adapting the system to meet new requirements over a period of time | Man | | |
| 8.8  | Portability  | Measured according to Gilb's measure (see below) | Man | | |
| 8.9  | Timeliness   | Assessed in terms of the costs of non-delivery. These will possibly include staff time and lost sales. It may also be assessed in terms of the number of days departure from the date agreed with client. | Man | | |
| 8.10 | Cost-Benefit efficiency | measured in simple financial terms. The costs of installing and maintaining the system are weighed against the assessment of business benefits | Man | | |
| 8.11 | Ease of transition | Assessed in terms of staff time expended. The effectiveness of transition may be assessed in terms of the quality of the resulting system particularly the area of integrity. | Man | | |
| 8.12 | Userfriendliness | Measured in terms of the effect upon the effectiveness of the user. The measure of user friendliness in business terms is the productivity of the user. | Man | | |

## Additional information

Reliability - These may be measured as:

* Mean Time to Failure = Total Time Period/Number of failures (1)
* Percentage Time Unavailable = (Time Unavailable/Total Time) x 100 (2)
* Percentage Information Loss = Information Pre-Failure (bytes) / Information Post-Recovery (bytes)

Portability - In Gitb's terms, measured as the effort required to move a system to a new environment
from its own environment expressed as:

P = 1 - (ET/ER),

where P represents portability, E T effort required to transfer the system to a new environment, and
ER represents the effort required to establish the system in its existing environment.
